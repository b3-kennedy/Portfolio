        <h2>About</h2>
        <div class ="main">    
            <p>In the third year of my degree, the entire group was given the task of developing a game. We were given the island as a starting point and were asked to create a game
                based on the Sega megadrive game Herzog Zwei. The cohort decided to adapt the game as a hybrid FPS / RTS multiplayer game where players control mechs and command AI units 
                to capture bases. The team I was involved in mainly worked on the environment and the jet movement and effects. This project was developed using the Unity game engine.
