        <h2>About</h2>
        <div class ="main">    
            <p>Turret Defence is a roguelike 2 player online multiplayer game made with Unity where players
                play as turrets and have to defend a wall from waves of enemies. At the end of each wave the players are offered
                upgrades, the catch being that the upgrades will give a negative effect to the other player,
                meaning that players will have to communicate effectively to become as strong as possible.
