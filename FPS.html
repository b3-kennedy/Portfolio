    <h2>About</h2>
    <div class ="main">    
        <p>The end goal for this project is to be an ability based multiplayer arena shooter. Currently the abilities are all movement based, but future abilities could have more 
            offensive capabilities such as an EMP grenade which disables enemy abilities. Multiple game modes could be included such as classic modes like team deathmatch and free
            for all. I am planning to include another game mode which would play similarly to a faster paced oddball game from the Halo series. The idea is that this game would have
            a competitive scene where can players can compete against each other.
