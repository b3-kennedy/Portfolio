        <h3>What is a Gameplay Programmer</h3>
        <p class = "centrepara">Gameplay Programmers write the code needed for the interactions that make the game fun to play. 
            They work with level designers to come to an agreement on what needs to be done to make the levels and gameplay fun and engaging.
            Gameplay programmers write the rules that decide what objects do in the game and also work on optimisation and fixing bugs</p>
