    <h2>About</h2>
    <div class ="main">    
        <p>In the second of my degree we were tasked with remaking an old Star Trek game called EGA Trek. This project was made using C++ in the ASGE game engine which is a bare bones
            2D game engine made by our lecturer for students to use.
