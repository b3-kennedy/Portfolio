    <h2>About</h2>
    <div class ="main">    
        <p>Advanced technology was a compulsory module we took in the third year. We were given the choice of three tasks out of nine to complete throughout the year. The options
            I chose were: Direct X FPS game, automatic level completeability checks and open world game.
